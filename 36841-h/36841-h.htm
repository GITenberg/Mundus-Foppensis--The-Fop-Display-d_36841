<p class="p2">Ladies,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I<i>n the Tacker together of <ins title="Printed
in blackletter font in the original"><b>Mundus Muliebris</b></ins>,
As it was a very great Piece of ill Manners, to unlock your
Dressing-Rooms without your Leave, so was it no less indecent in him
to expose your Wardrobes to the World, especially in such a Rhapsody
of Rhime Doggeril as looks much more like an Inventory than a Poem;
however, he has only pilfer'd away the Names of your Varieties
without doing ye any other Mischief; for there is nothing to be
found in all his Index, nor his Dictionary neither, but what becomes
a Person of Quality to give, and a Person of Quality to receive; and
indeed, considering how frail the mortal Estates of mortal Gentlemen
are, it argues but a common Prudence in Ladies to take Advantage of
the Kindness of their Admirers</i>; to make Hay while the Sun
shines; <i>well knowing how often they are inveigl'd out of their
Jointures upon all Occasions: Besides, it is a general Desire in
Men, that their Ladies should keep Home, and therefore it is but
reasonable they should make their Homes as delightful as it is
possible; and therefore this Bubble of an Inventory is not to be
thought the Effect of general Repentance, among your Servants and
Adorers, but the capricious Malice of some Person envious of the
little Remunerations of your Kindnesses for being disbandded from
your Conversation; little indeed, considering the Rewards due to
your Merits, otherwise it would be the greatest Injustice upon Earth
for the Men to think of reforming the Women before they reform
themselves, who are ten times worse in all respects, as you will
have sufficient to retort upon them when you come by and by to the
Matter.</i></p>

<p><i>But to shew that it is no new <ins title="'thtng' in the
original">thing</ins> for Ladies to go gay and gaudy, we find in</i>
Ovid, <i>that the Women made use of great Variety of Colours for the
Silks of which they made their Garments, of which the chiefest in
request among them were Azure, Sea-green, Saffron colour, Violet,
Ash colour, Rose colour, Chesnut, Almond Colour, with several
others, as their Fancy thought fit to make choice; nor were they
deny'd the Purple in Grain, overlaid with Pearl, or embroider'd with
Gold: Nor was it a strange thing for the Roman Women to die their
Hair Yellow, as an augmentation to their Beauty; nor did the
severity of the times at all oppose it, but rather allow'd it. Now,
says</i> Ovid, <i>The Manner of dressing is not of one sort, and
therefore let every Lady choose what best becomes her; first
consulting her Looking-glass. And soon after, he confesses that
there were not more Leaves upon a large Oak, not so many Bees in</i>
Hybla, <i>nor so many wild Beasts ranging the Alps as he could
number differences of dressing Ladies. He tells ye how</i> Laodamia
<i>drest to set off a long Face. How</i> Diana <i>drest when she
went a Hunting: And how</i> Iole <i>was carelessly drest when she
took</i> Alcides <i>Captive in the Dangles of her Tresses: So that
it is no such new thing for the Women of this Age to desire rich and
splendid Ornaments. And why their Grandmothers, and Great
Grandmothers confin'd themselves to their Nuptial Kirtles, their
Gowns and Petticoats that lasted so many Anniversaries; their
Virginals for Musick, and their Spanish Pavans, and Sellingers
Rounds for Recreation, after their long poring upon Tent-stitch,
'tis not a farthing Matter for our Ladies to enquire: 'Twas their
Misfortune they knew no better; but because they knew no better,
'tis no Argument that our Ladies should be ty'd to their obsolete
Examples: For the Alterations of Times and Customs alter the Humors
and Fashions of an Age, and change the whole Frame of
Conversation.</i> Juno <i>is by the Poets trick'd up in Vestments
embroidered with all the Colours of the Peacocks; and no question
the Poets spoke with Relation to the Gallantry of the Women of those
times. And who so gaudy as Madam</i> Iris <i>in the Skie, and
therefore said to be chief Maid of Honour to</i> Jupiter'<i>s Wife.
I could give ye an Account of the Habits of</i> Venus, <i>and the
Graces, which the Poets adapting to the Modes of those Times,
plainly demonstrates, that the Ladies were no less curious in those
days than now.</i></p>

<p><i>So then, Ladies, for your comfort be it spoken, here's only
a</i> Great Cry and little Wool; <i>while the Unlocker of your
Dressing-Rooms brings us a long Bedroll of hard Names to prove that
you make use of a great deal of Variety to set forth and grace your
Beauty, and render your Charms more unresistable, and that you love
to have your Closets splendidly and richly furnish'd: Heavens be
prais'd, he lays nothing Criminal to your Charge; but only puts ye
in mind of a Chapter in</i> Isaiah, <i>of which you are not bound to
take much notice, in regard his mistaking the 6. for the 3: may
secure ye there is little heed to be given to his Divinity.</i></p>

<p><i>But on the other side it makes me mad to hear what the Devil
of a Roman Satyr</i> Juvenal <i>speaks of his own Sex; for tho' he
makes Women bad enough, he makes it an easier thing to meet with
Prodigies and Monsters, than Men of Sense and Vertue.</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Should I behold in <i>Rome</i>, that Man, <i>says
  he</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">That were of spotless Fame, and Life unblam'd;</span>
<span class="i0">More than a Wonder it would be to me,</span>
<span class="i0">And I that Monster would compare to damn'd:</span>
<span class="i0">Two-headed Boy, with double Members born,</span>
<span class="i0">Or Fish, by Plow turn'd up, where lately Corn</span>
<span class="i0">In fertile Acres grew; or Fole by Mule</span>
<span class="i0">Brought forth, as Heaven would Nature
  over-rule:</span>
<span class="i0">No less amaz'd, than if a stoney Showre</span>
<span class="i0">Should from the Skie upon the Pavement pour;</span>
<span class="i0">Or that some Swarm of Bees, ascending higher</span>
<span class="i0">Than usually, should cluster on the Temple
  Spire;</span>
<span class="i0">Or that some rapid and impetuous Stream,</span>
<span class="i0">Should roll into the Sea, all Bloud, or Cream.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Heavens! how many Wonders do's</i> Juvenal <i>make at the
sight of an Honest Man in his time; and yet when he has spoken as
bad as he could of the Women, we find no such severe Expressions of
his upon the Female Sex. Now Ladies if good Men are so scarce, what
need you care what Fools and bad Men say. 'Tis true it must be
acknowledg'd a hard Censure upon Men; but it was a Man that said it;
and therefore it makes the better for the Feminine Gender. Well,
Ladies, you may be pleas'd to make what use of it you think fit, as
being that which will certainly defend ye against all the Picklocks
of your Dressing-Rooms for the future; besides the Liberty which</i>
Ovid, <i>an Authentick Author, gives ye, to make use of what
Dresses, what Ornaments, what Embellishments you please, according
to the Mode and Practice of those times, under one of the best
Rulers of the</i> Roman <i>Empire, and far more antient than when
your Grandmothers and Great Grandmothers spun Flax, and bespittl'd
their Fingers.</i></p>

<span class="i0">And stirr'd with like Satyrick Rage,</span>

<span class="i0">'Twas mean Revenge, howe'er, to fall</span>

<span class="i2">What if the Ladies will be brave,</span>
<span class="i0">Why may not they a Language have</span>
<span class="i0">To wrap their Trinkets up in Mystery?</span>
<span class="i0">Since Men are much more blam'd in History,</span>
<span class="i0">For tying up their Slipper peaks</span>
<span class="i0">With Silver Chains, that reach'd their Necks.</span>
<span class="i0">Was't not, d'ye think, a pleasant sight,</span>
<span class="i0">To see the smiling Surgeon slit</span>

<span class="i0">For wanton, foolish, and debauch'd;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet Learning is no Crime to Ladies,</span>
<span class="i0">And Terms of Art are still where Trade is.</span>
<span class="i0">Printers speak Gibb'rish at their Cafes;</span>
<span class="i0">And Weavers talk in unknown Phrases;</span>
<span class="i0">And Blacksmith's 'Prentice takes his Lessons</span>

<span class="i0">And is not <i>Colbertine</i>, God save us,</span>

<span class="i0">Is such a Bumpkin Cant as that</span>
<span class="i0">Fit for an Age where only what</span>
<span class="i0">Is brisk and airy, new refin'd,</span>
<span class="i0">Exalts the Wit, and clears the mind?</span>
<span class="i0">No ladies, no; go on your way;</span>
<span class="i0">Gay Cloaths require gay Words, we say.</span>
<span class="i2">When Art has trimm'd up Head-Attire,</span>

<span class="i0">And Head and Ornament are well met,</span>
<span class="i0">Like Amazonian Plume and Helmet;</span>
<span class="i0">To call that by a vulgar Name,</span>
<span class="i0">Would be too mean, and th' Artist shame;</span>
<span class="i0">Call it a <i>Septizonimum</i>, or <i>Tiara</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">Or what you please, that's new and rare-a.</span>
<span class="i0">May not the Head, the Seat of Sense,</span>
<span class="i0">Name it's own Dress, without Offence?</span>
<span class="i0">The Roman Ladies, you are told,</span>
<span class="i0">Wore such a Head-Attire of old;</span>
<span class="i0">And what if <i>Juvenal</i> were such a Satyr,</span>
<span class="i0">The Roman Ladies to bespatter;</span>
<span class="i0">Tell <i>Juvenal</i>, he was a Fool,</span>
<span class="i0">And must not think to <i>England</i> rule:</span>

<span class="i0">Let her out-dazle <i>Egypt</i>'s Queen:</span>
<span class="i0">It shows that Gold the Pocket lines,</span>

<span class="i0">And there's a sort of Pride becomes</span>
<span class="i0">The Pomp of Dress, as well as Rooms.</span>
<span class="i0">I would not for the world be thought</span>
<span class="i0">To pick a hole in Ladies Coat;</span>
<span class="i0">Because they make it their Delight,</span>
<span class="i0">To keep their Bodies trim and tite.</span>
<span class="i0">What though the Names be new, and such</span>
<span class="i0">As borrow from the French and Dutch?</span>
<span class="i0">Or strain'd from the Italian Idiom,</span>
<span class="i0">Rather from hence I take the Freedom,</span>
<span class="i0">To praise their Care, thus to enrich</span>
<span class="i0">And fructifie our barren Speech,</span>
<span class="i0">We owe to their Vocabulary,</span>
<span class="i0">That makes our Language full and airy,</span>
<span class="i0">Enlarging <i>Meige</i>'s Dictionary.</span>
<span class="i0">Where things want Names, Names must be had:</span>

<span class="i0">My Thing there, quilted white and red;</span>
<span class="i0">My Thing there for my Wrists and Neck;</span>
<span class="i0">'Tis ten to One the Maids mistake;</span>
<span class="i0">Then Lady cries, The Devil take</span>

<span class="i0">'Slife&mdash;Lady crys, if I rise up,</span>

<span class="i0">And thus, like <i>Babel</i>, in conclusion,</span>

<span class="i0">When as if Ladies name the Things,</span>
<span class="i0">The Maid, whate'er she bid her, brings;</span>
<span class="i0">Neither is Lady chaf'd with Anger,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor Bones of Maiden put in danger.</span>
<span class="i2">Sure then 'twas some ill-natur'd <i>Beau</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">To persecute the Ladies so;</span>
<span class="i0">For peopling, of their own accords,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Phillip's English World of Words</i>:</span>
<span class="i0">A <i>Beau</i> more cruel than the <i>Goths</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">Thus to deny the Women Cloaths:</span>

<span class="i0">Were Heathen Rites, and Superstitions;</span>
<span class="i0">Or else, as if from <i>Picts</i> descended,</span>
<span class="i0">He were with Women's Cloaths offended;</span>
<span class="i0">And spite of cold, or heat of air,</span>
<span class="i0">He lov'd to see Dame Nature bare.</span>
<span class="i0">Their Shoes and Stays, he says, are tawdry,</span>
<span class="i0">Not fit to wear 'cause of th' Embroidry.</span>
<span class="i0">For Petticoats he'd have e'm bare-breech'd,</span>
<span class="i0">From <i>India</i> 'cause the Stuffs are
  far-fetch'd.</span>
<span class="i0">Their Points and Lace he damns to Hell;</span>
<span class="i0">Corruptions of the Common-Weal.</span>
<span class="i0">The vain Exceptions of Wiseacres,</span>
<span class="i0">Fit to goe herd among the Quakers;</span>
<span class="i0">And talk to <i>Maudlin</i>, in close Hood,</span>
<span class="i0">Things that themselves ne'er understood.</span>
<span class="i0">Now let us then the <i>Beau</i> survey,</span>
<span class="i0">Has he no Baubles to display:</span>
<span class="i0">There's first the <i>Dango</i>, and the
  <i>Snake</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">Those <i>Dildoes</i> in the Nape of Neck;</span>
<span class="i0">That dangle down behind, to shew</span>

<span class="i0">And would be thought the Woman's Friend:</span>

<span class="i0">A Term of Art for Knees Concinnity,</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the Sense of School-Divinity.</span>
<span class="i2">What <i>Beau</i> himself would so unman,</span>
<span class="i0">To ride in scandalous Sedan?</span>
<span class="i0">A Carriage only fit for Midwives,</span>
<span class="i0">That of their Burthens go to rid Wives;</span>
<span class="i0">Unless to hide, from Revelation,</span>
<span class="i0">Th' Adulterer's haste to Assignation.</span>
<span class="i2">What Dunces are our Tonsors grown,</span>
<span class="i0">Where's their Gold Filings in an Amber Box,</span>

<span class="i0">That had whole Orchards at command.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet these are Toys, in Men, more wise,</span>
<span class="i0">To Womens innocent Vanities.</span>
<span class="i0">While soft Sir <i>Courtly Nice</i> looks great,</span>
<span class="i0">With the unmortgag'd Rents of his Estate:</span>
<span class="i0">What is the Learning he adores,</span>

<span class="i0">Of modern Gallants to entice</span>

<span class="i2">Bless us! what's there? 'tis something walks,</span>
<span class="i0">A piece of Painting, and yet speaks:</span>
<span class="i0">Hard Case to blame the Ladies Washes,</span>
<span class="i0">When Men are come to mend their Faces.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet some there are such Women grown,</span>
<span class="i0">They cann't be by their Faces known:</span>
<span class="i0">Some wou'd be like the fair <i>Adonis</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">Some would be <i>Hyacinthus</i> Cronies;</span>
<span class="i0">And then they study wanton use</span>
<span class="i0">Of Spanish Red, and white Ceruse;</span>
<span class="i0">The only Painters to the Life,</span>
<span class="i0">That seem with Natures self at strife;</span>
<span class="i0">As if she only the dead Colours laid,</span>
<span class="i0">But they the Picture perfect made.</span>
<span class="i0">What <i>Zeuxis</i> dare provoke these Elves,</span>
<span class="i0">That to out-doe him paint themselves?</span>
<span class="i0">For tho' the Birds his painted Grapes did crave,</span>
<span class="i0">These paint and all Mankind deceive.</span>
<span class="i0">This sure must spend a World of Morning,</span>
<span class="i0">More than the Ladies quick adorning;</span>
<span class="i0">They have found out a shorter way,</span>
<span class="i0">Not as before, to wast the day;</span>
<span class="i0">They only comb, wash hands and face,</span>
<span class="i0">And streightway, with a comely Grace,</span>
<span class="i0">On the admired <i>Helmet</i> goes,</span>
<span class="i0">As ready rigg'd as their lac'd Shoes.</span>
<span class="i0">Far much more time Men trifling wast,</span>
<span class="i0">E'er their soft Bodies can be drest;</span>
<span class="i0">The Looking-Glass hangs just before,</span>
<span class="i0">And each o'th' Legs requires an hour:</span>
<span class="i0">Now thereby, Ladies, hangs a Tale,</span>
<span class="i0">A Story for your Cakes and Ale.</span>
<span class="i0">A certain <i>Beau</i> was lately dressing,</span>
<span class="i0">But sure, e'er he had crav'd Heavens Blessing;</span>
<span class="i0">When in comes Friend, and finds him laid</span>
<span class="i0">In mournfull plight, upon his Bed.</span>
<span class="i0">Dear <i>Tom</i>, quoth he, such a Mischance</span>
<span class="i0">As ne'er befell the Foes of <i>France</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, I must tell thee, <i>Fleury</i> Battel</span>
<span class="i0">Was ne'er to <i>Europe</i> half so fatal;</span>
<span class="i0">For by I know not what ill luck,</span>
<span class="i0">My Glass this Morn fell down and broke</span>
<span class="i0">Upon my Shin, just in my Rolling;</span>
<span class="i0">Now is not this worth thy condoling?</span>
<span class="i0">See Stocking cut, and bloody Shin,</span>
<span class="i0">Besides the Charge of healing Skin.</span>
<span class="i0">'Twas the only Kindness of my Fate,</span>
<span class="i0">It mist the solid Piece, my Pate.</span>
<span class="i2">Ladies, this was ill luck, but you</span>
<span class="i0">Have much the worser of the two;</span>
<span class="i0">The World is chang'd I know not how,</span>
<span class="i0">For Men kiss Men, not Women now;</span>
<span class="i0">And your neglected Lips in vain,</span>
<span class="i0">Of smugling <i>Jack</i>, and <i>Tom</i>
  complain:</span>
<span class="i0">A most unmanly nasty Trick;</span>
<span class="i0">One Man to lick the other's Cheek;</span>
<span class="i0">And only what renews the shame</span>
<span class="i0">Of <i>J.</i> the first, and <i>Buckingham</i>:</span>
<span class="i0">He, true it is, his Wives Embraces fled</span>
<span class="i0">To slabber his lov'd <i>Ganimede</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">But to employ, those Lips were made</span>
<span class="i0">For Women in <i>Gomorrha</i>'s Trade;</span>
<span class="i0">Bespeaks the Reason ill design'd,</span>
<span class="i0">Of railing thus 'gainst Woman-kind:</span>
<span class="i0">For who that loves as Nature teaches,</span>
<span class="i0">That had not rather kiss the Breeches</span>
<span class="i0">Of Twenty Women, than to lick</span>
<span class="i0">The Bristles of one Male dear <i>Dick</i>?</span>
<span class="i2">Now wait on <i>Beau</i> to his <i>Alsatia</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">A Place that loves no <i>Dei Gratia</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">Where the Undoers live, and Undone,</span>
<span class="i0">In <i>London</i>, separate from <i>London</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">Where go but Three Yards from the street,</span>
<span class="i0">And you with a new Language meet:</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Prig</i>, <i>Prigster</i>, <i>Bubble</i>,
  <i>Caravan</i>,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pure Tackle</i>, <i>Buttock</i>, <i>Purest

<span class="i0"><i>Sealers</i>, <i>Putts</i>, <i>Equipp</i>, and

<span class="i0">With more a great deal of the same.</span>
<span class="i0">Should <i>Saffold</i> make but half this Rattle,</span>
<span class="i0">When Maidens visit his O-racle,</span>
<span class="i0">They'd take him for some Son of <i>Cham</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">Calling up Legion by his Name,</span>
<span class="i2">Add but to this the Flanty-Tant</span>
<span class="i0">Of Fopling Al-a-mode Gallant;</span>
<span class="i0">Why should not <i>Gris</i>, or <i>Jardine</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">Be as well allow'd as <i>Bien gaunte</i>;</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cloaths</i> is a paltry Word <i>Ma foy</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">But Grandeur in the French <i>Arroy</i>.</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Trimming</i>'s damn'd English, but <i>le
  Grass</i></span>
<span class="i0">Is that which must for Modish pass.</span>
<span class="i0">To call a Shoe a Shoe, is base,</span>
<span class="i0">Let the genteel <i>Picards</i> take Place.</span>
<span class="i0">Hang <i>Perriwig</i>, 'tis only fit</span>
<span class="i0">For Barbers Tongues that ne'er spoke Wit;</span>
<span class="i0">But if you'd be i'th' Fashion, choose</span>
<span class="i0">The far politer Term, <i>Chedreux</i></span>
<span class="i0">What Clown is he that proudly moves,</span>
<span class="i0">With on his hands what we call Gloves?</span>
<span class="i0">No Friend, for more refin'd converse</span>
<span class="i0">Will tell ye they are <i>Orangers</i>.</span>
<span class="i0">So strangely does <i>Parisian</i> Air</span>
<span class="i0">Change English Youth, that half a year</span>
<span class="i0">Makes 'em forget all Native Custome,</span>
<span class="i0">To bring French Modes, and <i>Gallic</i> Lust
  home;</span>
<span class="i0">Nothing will these Apostates please,</span>
<span class="i0">But <i>Gallic</i> Health, and French Disease.</span>
<span class="i0">In French their Quarrels, and their Fears,</span>
<span class="i0">Their Joys they publish, and their Cares;</span>
<span class="i0">In French they quarrel, and in French</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mon coeur,</i> they cry, to paltry Wench.</span>
<span class="i2">Why then should these Extravagants</span>
<span class="i0">Make such Rhime-doggeril Complaints</span>
<span class="i0">Against the Ladies Dressing-Rooms,</span>
<span class="i0">And closets stor'd with rich Perfumes?</span>
<span class="i0">There's nothing there but what becomes</span>
<span class="i0">The Plenty of a fair Estate:</span>
<span class="i0">Tho' Chimney Furniture of Plate,</span>
<span class="i0">Tho' Mortlake Tapestry, Damask-Bed;</span>
<span class="i0">Or Velvet all Embroidered;</span>
<span class="i0">Tho' they affect a handsome store,</span>
<span class="i0">Of part for State, of usefull more;</span>
<span class="i0">They're Glories not to be deny'd</span>
<span class="i0">To Women, stopping there their Pride;</span>
<span class="i0">For such a Pride has nothing ill,</span>
<span class="i0">But only makes them more genteel.</span>
<span class="i0">Should Nature these fine Toys produce,</span>
<span class="i0">And Women be debarr'd the use?</span>
<span class="i0">These are no Masculine Delights;</span>
<span class="i0">Studies of Books for Men are sights;</span>
<span class="i0">A Stable with good Horses stor'd,</span>
<span class="i0">And Payment punctual to their Word:</span>
<span class="i0">Proportion these things to my Wishes,</span>
<span class="i0">Let Women take the Porcelan Dishes;</span>
<span class="i0">The Toylet Plates gilt and embost,</span>
<span class="i0">With all the rest of little cost;</span>
<span class="i0">Such small Diffusion feeds the Poor,</span>
<span class="i0">While Misers hoard up all their store.</span>
<span class="i2">Our Satyr then was one of those</span>
<span class="i0">Who ne'er had Wealth at his dispose;</span>
<span class="i0">Or being sped to live in Plenty,</span>
<span class="i0">Posted to find his Coffers empty;</span>
<span class="i0">Addicted all to sport and Gaming,</span>
<span class="i0">And that same Vice not worth the naming;</span>
<span class="i0">Till deeply dipp'd in Us'rers Books,</span>
<span class="i0">And over-rid by Cheats and Rooks,</span>
<span class="i0">The <i>Mint</i> becomes his Sanctuary,</span>
<span class="i0">Where not of his past Errors weary,</span>
<span class="i0">But aged grown, and impotent,</span>
<span class="i0">Alike in Purse and Codpiece spent,</span>
<span class="i0">He <i>Cynic</i> turns, in <i>Kings-Bench</i>
  Tub,</span>
<span class="i0">And vents the Froth of Brewers Bub:</span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
